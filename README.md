# Concert-Alerter-Bot
Over the years, I've missed out on seeing some of my favourite artists simply because I didn't know they had an event scheduled in my area. After watching my brother in physical pain for a couple days this summer from missing the opportunity to buy tickets and see some of his favourite rappers, I decided to finally make a Discord bot that would help us out.

This bot alerts you with the Ticketmaster link, and the minimum ticket price to your Discord account if it finds that the artist(s) you're currently listening to on Spotify has an event/concert scheduled in your set area in the next year.

My brother and I have gotten in the habit of running this bot locally every month or so to keep us updated on what artists are performing.
